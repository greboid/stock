# Simple Stock System #

Stock system for managing an inventory of stock spanning several sites and locations.

### How do I get set up? ###

 * Create a database and associated user
 * Copy to server
 * Download dependencies (smarty only so far)
 * Move config_sample.php to config.php and update settings

### TODO ###
 * Authentication
 * Bower - For javascript deps (all use a CDN at the minute)
 * Composer - For PHP deps
